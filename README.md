# To-Be-Named Sidescroller exploration game

## Purpose
This is really mostly for me to play around and learn new stuff in phaser, but with the goal of creating a large-world sidescroller.

If you want to run this (for whatever reason, this whole repo is just me messing around), just point webroot at this folder, and browse to index.html.

## Notes
(This section is mostly for me to take notes on ideas, thoughts, or just tricky things about Phaser that I should remember in the future)
